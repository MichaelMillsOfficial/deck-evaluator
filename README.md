# MTG Deck Evaluator

A web application for importing and analyzing Magic: The Gathering decklists. Built with Next.js and TypeScript.

Import a deck (paste, Moxfield export, or Archidekt URL) and the app walks you through a four-stage **journey** — *import → ritual → reading → sub-route*. The reading lands on a verdict hero (bracket, power level, top theme), then fans out across eleven sub-routes for cards, composition, meta, synergy, interactions, opening hands, goldfish simulation, suggestions, candidate finder, deck-vs-deck compare, and share/export. Cards are automatically enriched via Scryfall (mana costs as official MTG symbols, oracle text with inline symbols, heuristic tags), combos are detected via Commander Spellbook, and a neutral **Stock ↔ Spicy** meta read (EDHREC staple coverage plus a per-card inclusion heat list) shows how conventional or off-meta your card choices are.

Don't have a finished deck yet? **The Crucible** (`/crucible`) is a deck-building workbench: pour in any pile of cards (paste or a Forge-style `.dck` file), organize it through lenses (category, synergy axis, type line, mana value, color identity, game changers), triage each card as keep/cut/undecided with an explicit commander pick, search up and add more cards mid-triage, share the pile via link or `.dck` download, and seal a legal 100-card Commander deck that flows straight into the reading journey (cuts are kept as sideboard candidates).

See [Promises to You](./PROMISES.md) for how this tool handles your data and what drives the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Use `docker compose up --build` to rebuild after code changes.

```bash
docker compose up -d           # Run in background
docker compose down            # Stop and remove containers
docker compose logs -f         # Tail logs
```

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start development server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run start` | Run production server |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint |
| `npm test` | Run all tests (e2e + unit, headless) |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Run only browser/API e2e tests |
| `npm run test:unit` | Run only pure function unit tests (fast, no dev server) |
| `npm run test:headed` | Run e2e tests with visible browser |
| `npm run test:ui` | Open Playwright interactive e2e UI |

## Routes

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Import surface (paste · Moxfield · Archidekt) |
| `/ritual` | Cosmic loader, held until enrichment terminates |
| `/reading` | Verdict hero + reading-overview tile grid |
| `/reading/cards` | Full card list, grouped by section |
| `/reading/composition` | Mana curve, color pie, type breakdown |
| `/reading/synergy` | Synergy axes + pair detector |
| `/reading/interactions` | Removal / protection / chains |
| `/reading/hands` | Opening-hand keep simulator |
| `/reading/goldfish` | Monte Carlo goldfish stats |
| `/reading/suggestions` | Cut/add/swap recommendations |
| `/reading/add` | Candidate finder (typeahead → analysis) |
| `/reading/compare` | Deck-vs-deck redirect to `/compare` |
| `/reading/share` | Share URL · PNG · Discord · Markdown · JSON |
| `/shared` | Decode share URL → forward to `/reading` |
| `/crucible` | The Crucible: pile triage workbench → seal a legal EDH deck |
| `/compare` | Standalone two-deck comparison |
| `/preview` | Design-system component preview |

State flows through `DeckSessionContext` (sessionStorage-backed) so navigation between sub-routes does not refetch the deck or re-enrich cards. `CandidatesContext` is mounted at the `/reading/(shell)` layout so candidate state on `/reading/add` survives tab switches. The Crucible keeps its own `CrucibleSessionContext` under a separate sessionStorage key, so a pile in progress coexists with a reading session.

## Testing

This project uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for two test suites: browser/API e2e tests in `e2e/` (run against the Next.js dev server, started automatically via `webServer` in `playwright.config.ts`) and pure function unit tests in `tests/unit/` (no browser, no dev server, run under `playwright.unit.config.ts`).

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test                                          # Run all tests (e2e + unit) headless
npm run test:e2e                                  # Run only browser/API e2e tests
npm run test:unit                                 # Run only pure function unit tests (fast)
npm run test:headed                               # Run e2e tests with a visible browser
npm run test:ui                                   # Open Playwright interactive e2e UI
npx playwright test --config playwright.config.ts e2e/deck-import.spec.ts  # Single e2e file
```
