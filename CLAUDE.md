# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Magic: The Gathering utility repository providing intelligent analysis of deck construction and performance. Built with Next.js and TypeScript.

## Commands

Once dependencies and source code are in place, standard Next.js commands apply:

```bash
npm install        # Install dependencies
npm run dev        # Start development server
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Run production server
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm test           # Run tests (once a test framework is configured)
```

## Architecture

This is a Next.js application (TypeScript). The .gitignore confirms the expected structure:
- `/.next/` — Next.js build output
- `/out/` — Static export output
- `/build/` — Production build artifacts
- `/coverage/` — Test coverage reports

The project is in its initial state. As source code is added, update this file with the actual architecture, key modules, and data flow.
